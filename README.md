# ml_models
Three implementations of a prediction-classification, image processing (CNN model) and a time series model (LSTM). The folder is made up of the following contents:

* Part of my PhD thesis in feature selection
* CNN model with `tf.Estimator`
* LSTM model to predict a time series data from an industrial process.
Meanwhile, the data sets are not included in each project due to privacy concerns.
* Publication: In view
